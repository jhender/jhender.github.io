**Project Overview:**
Personal Insurance page is a memory dump of things I have learnt or discovered lately while reading up more on personal insurance. I'm far from an expert or professional, but hopefully with enough simple info to get by.

## Objectives

1. Coverage for a family of 2 adults and 2 young children
2. Largely separate from investment or savings, as we intend to leave this to other sources (again, not perfect, but acceptable)


## Insurance types we like or have
(note this section is not particularly sorted by coverage, maybe it would work better as a matrix table)

1. **Whole Life:**

- Users are assigned an EcoScore based on their sustainable activities and choices.
- Daily and weekly challenges encourage users to adopt new habits and compete with friends or the community to earn EcoPoints.

2. **Personalized Eco-Goals:**

- Users can set and track personalized eco-goals, such as reducing plastic usage, conserving water, or choosing eco-friendly transportation.
- The app provides tips and suggestions to help users achieve their goals.

3. **Green Rewards Marketplace:**

- EcoPoints earned through challenges and sustainable actions can be redeemed in a virtual Green Rewards Marketplace.
- The marketplace offers discounts on eco-friendly products, services, and even contributions to environmental causes.

4. **Community Hub:**

- A community feature allows users to connect, share their eco-friendly achievements, and inspire others.
- Users can join local eco-groups, organize clean-up events, and collaborate on sustainability projects.

5. **EcoEducator AI Assistant:**

- An AI-powered assistant, EcoEducator, provides personalized eco-tips, facts, and information based on users' preferences and habits.
- Users can chat with EcoEducator for instant advice on sustainable living.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React Native for cross-platform mobile app development.
- Backend: Firebase for real-time data synchronization and user authentication.
- Database: Firestore for scalable and flexible data storage.
- AI Integration: Dialogflow for natural language processing and conversation with EcoEducator.

## Outcome

EcoBuddy has successfully created a community of environmentally conscious individuals who actively participate in sustainable living practices. The app not only educates and motivates users but also provides tangible rewards for their commitment to a greener lifestyle, fostering a positive impact on the environment.

## Client Testimonial
