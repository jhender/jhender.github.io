## Jib

**Greetings!** My casual moniker is Jib. Just someone who likes tech stuff, geeky stuff, nerdy stuff, Google Maps Local Guide stuff. 


### Google Maps Local Guide

Proud to be one of the early batches of Google Maps Local Guides, zooming to Level 10 and having an insane 1 Billion photo views. Wheee. That's back when I had so much more time to go around and do mapping, adding places to Maps, adding photos and details and even spending a lot of time on 360 photos. 

Went to Google's offices in USA twice for their Summit program and met lots of very very passionate people, from all around the world.

### Tech

A diverse interest which perhaps I'll slowly share over time in various posts.
