## To faster speeds and beyond

<h3>

Network v1 when we moved into this house
- Router - Edgerouter Lite (which died and got replaced by:)
- Router - Unifi Security Gateway (USG) (1G, limited IDS processing)
- Access Point - UAP-AC-Pro (x2 units) (wifi 4, Wifi 5)
- Switch - Unifi Switch 24 (1G, non POE)
- ISP - ViewQwest 1 Gbps with static IP


# Pricing drops over the years have led to 3 Gbps plans being similar or slightly cheaper than previous gen 1 Gbps plans

Well then, if I am paying less, why not switch right?

At the same time Unifi also just released their UXG Fiber, which is a small unit that supports 10G routing, instead of having to use their wayyyy too big Dream Machine Pro/SE. This thing is now smaller, faster, more capable and has better ports. Wow.

Network v2
- Router - Unifi Gateway Fiber (UXG) 
- Access Point - Unifi U7 Pro (x2 units) (Wifi 6, Wifi 7)
- Switch - Unifi Switch 24 (1G, non POE) [no change]
- ISP - ViewQwest 3 Gbps with static IP


# UXG

Look at those incredible ports.
1. It has proper 10G WAN
2. It can even support 10G SFP+ (in multiple)
3. It has multiple 2.5G LAN ports - perfect for supporting Wifi 6 and Wifi 7 at >1Gbps. Even one POE port!
4. It can actually support IDS/IPS at a high speed

# U7 Pro

![](../assets/post5-u7box.jpg)

I was deliberating between this and U6 series, since it's really quite enough speed, I don't have that many Wifi 7 devices, especially for the other people at home, and Wifi 7's 6 Ghz channels and other features were not fully mature and U7 had IOT issues initially.

But it was better this way because
- It's a super PITA to change out a ceiling AP
- I don't want to touch it again for yearssssss
- This means that it's overall cheaper to pay a bit more for U7 Pro and not labor charges again

![trying to remove the old AP](../assets/post5-removeap.png)
It's really tiring doing ceiling work, esp top of ceiling. Arms and shoulders aren't used to that length-of-time up.

New bracket is metal and really beautiful, compared to plain plastic old one

![beautiful speedtest results on Pixel 8. 1764 Mbps](../assets/post5-speedtest.png)
Pretty awesome that I can get a speedtest result of 1700 Mbps at 6 Ghz 160 width. Wow, technically higher peak speeds than the 1G LAN ports. BUT LAN still trumps on many factors like stability, consistency, lower latency, no congestion on number of devices and neighbours. (My home LAN wiring is also upgradable to 2.5 or 10G if required)
