## Home Renovation 2025

# A major change in home plans, including the following highlights

- A new partition-ed room, which is a possible studyroom but mostly as a helper room for now
- One of the bedrooms reclaimed from helper room/storage/studio, to be Kids Bedroom 1
- Other room to be Kids Bedroom 2
- Disposing of our old/original Living Room IKEA cabinets (which we painstakingly and lovingly hand painted and varnished and built during COVID)
- Putting in brand new custom made full wall living room cabinets, with TV section, with an upgraded full height proper size shoe cabinet (to also cater for extra headcount worth of shoes)
- An simple looking but elaborately designed sliding panel in front of the TV to hide it when not in use (we like to keep the children away from TV time, and have less focuso on it)
- New coat of paint all over the house in order to kill mould/bugs and also refresh the walls
- Possible fixing of mouldy silicone around kitchen cooking area and bathrooms
- Possible fixing of rusty spots on toilet door frames

# Other frills
Internet/Networking
- Upgrade of home internet from 1 Gbps fiber to 3 Gbps (although I'm getting fairly high 7 Gbps down and 2+ Gbps up speeds)
- New Unifi Ultra Gateway Fiber 10 Gbps router
- New 2x Unifi U7 Pro Wifi7 Access Points, with 2.5G ports
- Re-routing of multiple wall LAN ports to new positions due to the new rooms
Smart Home
- Aqara set - Hub M3 (supports Zigbee, Matter, Thread), Aqara wall light switches (multiple variants)
- Home Assistant automations
